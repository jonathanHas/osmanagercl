## Database Changes

### New Table: `invoice_attachments`
```sql
CREATE TABLE invoice_attachments (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    invoice_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    original_filename VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    stored_filename VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    file_path VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    mime_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    file_size BIGINT NOT NULL,
    file_hash VARCHAR(255),
    description VARCHAR(255),
    attachment_type ENUM('invoice_scan', 'receipt', 'delivery_note', 'other') DEFAULT 'invoice_scan',
    is_primary BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    uploaded_by BIGINT,
    uploaded_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    external_osaccounts_path VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    
    FOREIGN KEY (invoice_id) REFERENCES invoices(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (uploaded_by) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    
    INDEX idx_invoice_id (invoice_id),
    INDEX idx_external_osaccounts_path (external_osaccounts_path),
    INDEX idx_invoice_attachment_type (invoice_id, attachment_type),
    INDEX idx_uploaded_by_date (uploaded_by, uploaded_at)
);
```

### Model Extensions
Added to `Invoice` model:
- `attachments()` relationship
- `primaryAttachment()` method
- `hasAttachments()` boolean check
- `getAttachmentCountAttribute()` accessor

## Route Structure

### Attachment Management Routes
```php
// Upload and list attachments for specific invoice
Route::prefix('invoices/{invoice}/attachments')->name('invoices.attachments.')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/', [InvoiceAttachmentController::class, 'index'])->name('index');
    Route::post('/', [InvoiceAttachmentController::class, 'store'])->name('store');
    Route::get('/config', [InvoiceAttachmentController::class, 'getUploadConfig'])->name('config');
});

// Individual attachment operations
Route::prefix('invoice-attachments/{attachment}')->name('invoices.attachments.')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/view', [InvoiceAttachmentController::class, 'view'])->name('view');
    Route::get('/download', [InvoiceAttachmentController::class, 'download'])->name('download');
    Route::patch('/', [InvoiceAttachmentController::class, 'update'])->name('update');
    Route::delete('/', [InvoiceAttachmentController::class, 'destroy'])->name('destroy');
});
```

### Route Model Binding
Added to `AppServiceProvider`:
```php
Route::bind('attachment', function (string $value) {
    return InvoiceAttachment::findOrFail($value);
});
```

## Controller Implementation

### Key Controller Methods

#### File Upload (`store`)
```php
public function store(Request $request, Invoice $invoice)
{
    // Validates up to 5 files, 10MB each
    // Supports PDF, images, documents
    // Creates UUID-based filenames
    // Sets proper file permissions
    // Returns JSON response with attachment details
}
```

#### File Viewing (`view`)
```php
public function view(InvoiceAttachment $attachment)
{
    // Checks file existence and permissions
    // Returns file response for in-browser viewing
    // Supports PDFs, images, text files
    // Falls back to download for non-viewable files
}
```

#### File Download (`download`)
```php
public function download(InvoiceAttachment $attachment)
{
    // Secure file download with proper headers
    // Preserves original filename
    // Logs download activity
}
```

## JavaScript Integration

### Frontend Features
Located in `resources/views/invoices/show.blade.php`:

#### Upload Modal
```javascript
// Modern upload interface with:
// - File selection and validation
// - Progress indicators
// - Attachment type selection
// - Description field
// - Error handling
```

#### Attachment Display
```javascript
// Dynamic attachment rendering with:
// - File type icons
// - Truncated long filenames
// - Action buttons (view/download/delete)
// - Responsive layout
// - Real-time updates
```

#### AJAX Operations
```javascript
// Asynchronous operations:
// - Load attachments on page load
// - Upload files with progress
// - Delete attachments with confirmation
// - Update display without page refresh
```

## Security Implementation

### Access Control
- All routes protected by `auth` middleware
- Route model binding with automatic 404 for unauthorized access
- File access validation in controller methods

### File Security
- Files stored in `storage/app/private` (outside web root)
- UUID-based filenames prevent file path guessing
- MIME type and extension validation
- File size limits (10MB per file)

### Storage Permissions
```bash
# Directory structure with proper permissions
storage/app/private/invoices/
├── 2025/ (755)
│   └── 08/ (755)
│       └── 1/ (755)
│           └── uuid-filename.pdf (644)
```

## OSAccounts Migration

### Payment Status Logic Fixed
Updated `OSInvoice` model with correct payment status logic:
```php
public function getPaymentStatusAttribute()
{
    if ($this->PaidDate) {
        return 'paid'; // Has specific paid date
    }
    
    $isUnpaid = OSInvoiceUnpaid::where('InvoiceID', $this->ID)->exists();
    
    if ($isUnpaid) {
        // In INVOICES_UNPAID table = still outstanding
        return $this->InvoiceDate->addDays(30)->isPast() ? 'overdue' : 'pending';
    }
    
    // Not in INVOICES_UNPAID and no PaidDate = paid (date unknown)
    return 'paid';
}
```

### File Import Command
Created `ImportOSAccountsAttachments` command:
- Locates OSAccounts invoices with file attachments
- Copies files to Laravel private storage
- Creates attachment records with proper metadata
- Handles various OSAccounts file organization patterns

### Currency Conversion
Updated all invoice views from £ to €:
- Invoice listings and statistics
- Invoice detail pages
- Create/edit forms
- VAT breakdown displays

## Testing & Verification

### Functionality Tested
1. ✅ **File Upload**: Multiple files with validation
2. ✅ **File Viewing**: In-browser PDF/image viewing
3. ✅ **File Download**: Secure downloads with proper headers
4. ✅ **File Deletion**: Removes file and database record
5. ✅ **Attachment Display**: Responsive UI with truncated filenames
6. ✅ **Permission System**: Proper file/directory permissions
7. ✅ **Route Model Binding**: Automatic model resolution
8. ✅ **Payment Status Logic**: Correct OSAccounts integration

### Known Working Examples
- **Test File**: `test-invoice-8873.txt` (59 B) on Invoice #8873
- **Real File**: `fge_50148307_4702287_22-01-2025` (29.35 kB) on Invoice #8136
- **File Types**: Text files, PDFs tested and working
- **UI**: Long filename truncation and action buttons working

## Deployment Notes

### Required Permissions
```bash
# Storage directories must be writable by web server
chmod -R 775 storage/app/private/invoices/
chgrp -R www-data storage/app/private/invoices/

# Individual files should be readable
chmod 644 storage/app/private/invoices/**/*.{pdf,jpg,png,txt,doc,docx}
```

### Environment Configuration
Ensure `.env` has proper storage configuration:
```env
FILESYSTEM_DISK=local
# Private storage automatically configured
```

### Database Migration
Migration already applied:
```bash
# Already run - do not run again
# php artisan migrate
```

## Performance Considerations

### File Organization Strategy
- Files organized by year/month/invoice: `invoices/2025/08/1/`
- Prevents large directory performance issues
- Enables easy archiving and backup strategies
- Supports high volume file storage

### Database Optimization
- Proper indexing on foreign keys and frequently queried fields
- Efficient relationship loading with `with()` clauses
- Attachment count caching via Eloquent accessors

### Frontend Optimization
- Lazy loading of attachments via AJAX
- Progress indicators for upload feedback
- Responsive design minimizes mobile data usage

## Troubleshooting Guide

### File Permission Issues
**Symptom**: Cannot create directories or upload files
**Solution**: Fix storage permissions as documented above

### Route Not Found Errors  
**Symptom**: 404 errors on attachment URLs
**Solution**: Clear route cache: `php artisan route:clear`

### File Not Found on View/Download
**Symptom**: "File not found" when clicking view/download
**Solution**: Check file permissions (should be 644) and path exists

### Long Filename Display Issues
**Symptom**: Action buttons not visible on long filenames
**Solution**: UI automatically handles this with CSS truncation

### Authentication Redirects
**Symptom**: Redirected to login when accessing attachments
**Solution**: Ensure user is logged in - this is correct security behavior

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Log Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor attachment-related activities
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep -i "attachment\|upload\|download"
```

### Storage Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor storage usage
du -sh storage/app/private/invoices/
```

### Database Monitoring
```sql
-- Monitor attachment usage
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_attachments,
    SUM(file_size) as total_size_bytes,
    AVG(file_size) as avg_size_bytes,
    attachment_type,
    COUNT(*) as count_by_type
FROM invoice_attachments 
GROUP BY attachment_type;
```

## Next Steps & Enhancements

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Test File Import**: Run OSAccounts file import command when ready
2. **User Training**: Train users on new attachment functionality  
3. **Monitor Usage**: Watch logs for any issues or performance concerns

### Future Enhancements
1. **Cloud Storage**: Implement AWS S3 or Google Cloud storage
2. **Image Thumbnails**: Generate previews for image attachments
3. **Bulk Operations**: Zip download for multiple attachments
4. **Advanced Search**: Full-text search within documents
5. **File Versioning**: Support multiple versions of documents

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Email Integration**: Attach files when emailing invoices
2. **API Expansion**: RESTful API for external integrations
3. **Mobile App**: Native mobile app file management
4. **Document Workflow**: Approval processes for attachments
