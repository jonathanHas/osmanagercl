# Delivery API Endpoints

This document covers the REST API endpoints for the delivery verification system, including CSV import, scanning operations, and completion workflows.

## Overview

The Delivery API provides endpoints for managing supplier deliveries from initial CSV import through scanning verification to completion. It supports multi-format CSV processing (Udea and Independent Irish Health Foods formats) with real-time scanning capabilities.

## Authentication

All endpoints require authentication via Laravel's session-based authentication system.

The system does not currently support webhooks, but the following events are logged internally:
- `delivery.created` - New delivery imported
- `delivery.item.scanned` - Item scanned
- `delivery.completed` - Delivery marked as complete
- `product.created_from_delivery` - Product created from delivery item

### Debugging

Enable Laravel debugging to see detailed error messages:
```env
APP_DEBUG=true
