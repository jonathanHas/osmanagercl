## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Changes
```sql
-- Added to order_items table
ALTER TABLE order_items ADD COLUMN case_units INTEGER DEFAULT 1;
ALTER TABLE order_items ADD COLUMN suggested_cases DECIMAL(8,3) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE order_items ADD COLUMN final_cases DECIMAL(8,3) DEFAULT 0;
```

### Key Service Methods
- `OrderService::calculateProductSuggestion()` - Core logic for case calculations
- `OrderService::updateOrderItemCases()` - Case quantity updates
- `OrderService::updateOrderItemCost()` - Cost management

### API Endpoints
- `PATCH /order-items/{id}/cases` - Update case quantities
- `PATCH /order-items/{id}/cost` - Update item costs
- `POST /products/update-priority` - Update product priorities

### Frontend Components
- Smart tab navigation with dynamic counters
- Case-specific quantity controls
- Real-time cost calculation display
- Responsive table layout

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

### 1. Data Inconsistency Issue
**Problem:** Sales data showing conflicting information (weekly avg 3.19 but 6-month total 0)  
**Root Cause:** STOCKDIARY uses product UUIDs, not barcodes  
**Resolution:** Verified calculation was correct, issue was stale browser cache

### 2. Double Multiplication Bug
**Problem:** Costs showing €555.00 instead of realistic amounts  
**Root Cause:** PRICEBUY was being multiplied by case units when it's already per ordering unit  
**Resolution:** Removed unnecessary multiplication, PRICEBUY is per case/ordering unit

### 3. Cost Hierarchy Error
**Problem:** System using selling price instead of purchase price for ordering  
**Root Cause:** Incorrect priority in cost calculation hierarchy  
**Resolution:** Updated hierarchy to prioritize PRICEBUY (purchase price per ordering unit)

### 4. UI Layout Issues
**Problem:** Table too narrow requiring horizontal scrolling  
**Root Cause:** Container width constraints and excessive padding  
**Resolution:** Changed container to full-width and reduced padding

## 📊 Performance Improvements

### User Experience
- **Default view optimization:** Shows only products needing orders (quantity > 0)
- **Smart sorting:** Unordered items sorted by sales for strategic decisions
- **Reduced scrolling:** Full-width table layout eliminates horizontal scroll
- **Efficient workflow:** Tab-based filtering for focused review

### System Performance
- **Batch processing:** Order items processed in batches of 100
- **Optimized queries:** Strategic use of Eloquent relationships
- **Real-time updates:** AJAX endpoints for immediate feedback
- **Memory efficiency:** Proper cleanup and garbage collection

## 🔮 System Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Product Selection:** Based on supplier relationships and sales history
2. **Suggestion Calculation:** AI analysis using safety factors and trends
3. **Case Logic:** Automatic case quantity calculations
4. **Cost Resolution:** Hierarchical cost source determination
5. **User Review:** Smart filtering and editing interface
6. **Export/Completion:** CSV generation and order finalization

### Integration Points
