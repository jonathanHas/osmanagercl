a udea product quick add feature that would allow the user to scan a products barcode or enter the udeas product code and would retrieve the relevant data to enter the product details by scrapping the info from the website. we already have the code for scrapping the info, and from what I can see the url that we make can take either the barcode or supplier code

Fuit and Veg
quick review section, make a handy and simple mobile page that the user can select which products need a label and change the country of origin if needed


Price changes

Receipt section...

Daily Totals...



Management
    VAT returns

New features - low priority for the momenet
    - ability to assign values to categories to get a better breakdown of costs & profits
        for example an invoice might come in at 1000, some items may be for the kitchen if we have a way to identify these and extract the value we can then assign that cost to the kitchen.


Bringing it all together
    An overall profit and costs page, built on a model that allows us to fine tune over time to get a better insight into the business.



Updates to /fruit-veg/product/2012 don't seend the product to the label already NEED TO CHECK - I originally looked in labels and not in Fruit and Veg labels

Sales analysis
Identify busy periods

Simple Accounts, have a page that gives a very simple return of the amount of money taken in for a period and the outgoings for that same period and gives reasonable indication of how the business is doing
