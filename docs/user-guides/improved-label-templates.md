# Improved Label Templates User Guide

## What's New

The label system has been significantly improved with better text sizing and no more price cropping. The new **Grid 4x9 Custom** template is now the default and provides much better readability.

## Key Improvements

### 📝 Better Text Sizing
Product names now use smarter font sizing that makes better use of available space:

- **Short names** like "Milk Alt OAT" → Large, easy-to-read fonts
- **Medium names** like "NHP Sleep Support (60cps)" → Optimally sized fonts  
- **Long names** like "3 Little Goats Goat cheese spread natural 150g" → Larger fonts than before with better space utilization

### 💶 No More Price Cropping
Prices are now displayed completely without being cut off:

- **Before**: "€32.9" (cropped)  
- **After**: "€32.95" (complete)

All prices display at larger, more readable font sizes.
