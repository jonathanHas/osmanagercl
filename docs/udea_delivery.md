# Udea Delivery Verification System

## Overview

A comprehensive delivery verification system that automates the process of checking deliveries against delivery notes, identifying discrepancies, and updating stock levels. The system replaces manual comparison processes with an integrated workflow that handles CSV import, barcode scanning, and stock management.

## System Workflow

### 1. Pre-Delivery Phase
- **CSV Import**: Upload Udea delivery CSV file for parsing
- **Product Matching**: Automatically match supplier codes to existing products in database
- **New Product Identification**: Flag products not found in system (no matching supplier code)
- **Barcode Retrieval**: Queue automatic barcode extraction from Udea website for new products
- **Delivery Preparation**: Create delivery record with all expected items and quantities

### 2. Receiving Phase
- **Barcode Scanning**: Scan physical product barcodes during delivery
- **Real-Time Matching**: Match scanned barcodes to delivery items
- **Quantity Tracking**: Record received quantities vs expected quantities
- **Visual Progress**: Live dashboard showing completion status
- **Exception Handling**: Track unmatched scans and missing items

### 3. Verification Phase
- **Discrepancy Analysis**: Identify missing, excess, or partial deliveries
- **Value Calculation**: Calculate financial impact of discrepancies
- **Report Generation**: Create supplier credit claims for missing items
- **Manual Adjustments**: Allow quantity corrections for damaged items

### 4. Completion Phase
- **Stock Updates**: Automatically update POS stock levels for verified items
- **Cost Price Updates**: Update product costs if supplier prices changed
- **Delivery Archive**: Store complete delivery record for audit trail
- **Integration**: Sync with existing POS stock management

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

#### Deliveries Table
- `id` - Primary key
- `delivery_number` - Unique delivery identifier
- `supplier_id` - Foreign key to suppliers
- `delivery_date` - Expected/actual delivery date
- `status` - draft, receiving, completed, cancelled
- `total_expected` - Expected delivery value
- `total_received` - Actual received value
- `import_data` - JSON store of original CSV data
- `notes` - Additional delivery notes

#### Delivery Items Table
- `id` - Primary key
- `delivery_id` - Foreign key to deliveries
- `supplier_code` - Internal supplier code (not scannable)
- `sku` - Product SKU if available
- `barcode` - EAN/UPC barcode for scanning
- `description` - Product description
- `units_per_case` - Number of units per case
- `unit_cost` - Cost per unit
- `ordered_quantity` - Expected quantity
- `received_quantity` - Actually received quantity
- `total_cost` - Total line cost
- `status` - pending, partial, complete, missing, excess
- `product_id` - Link to POS products table
- `is_new_product` - Flag for products not in system

#### Delivery Scans Table
- `id` - Primary key
- `delivery_id` - Foreign key to deliveries
- `delivery_item_id` - Foreign key to delivery items (if matched)
- `barcode` - Scanned barcode
- `quantity` - Scanned quantity
- `matched` - Boolean if scan matched delivery item
- `scanned_by` - User who performed scan
- `timestamp` - When scan occurred

### Core Components

#### DeliveryService
**Primary Functions:**
- `importFromCsv()` - Parse CSV and create delivery records
- `processScan()` - Handle barcode scans and matching
- `getDeliverySummary()` - Generate discrepancy reports
- `completeDelivery()` - Finalize delivery and update stock

**CSV Parsing Logic:**
- Extract product details from Udea CSV format
- Parse units per case from content field (e.g., "4 pc", "1 kilogram")
- Calculate unit costs and total values
- Identify case vs unit quantities

#### Enhanced UdeaScrapingService
**Additional Functions:**
- `extractBarcodeFromDetail()` - Extract EAN/UPC from product detail pages
- Support for both English and Dutch product pages
- Improved error handling for barcode extraction
- Queue-based processing for multiple products

#### Delivery Models
- **Delivery** - Main delivery record with relationships
- **DeliveryItem** - Individual line items with status tracking
- **DeliveryScan** - Audit trail of all scans performed

### User Interface

#### Delivery Import Interface
- Supplier selection dropdown
- CSV file upload with validation
- Preview of parsed items before import
- Identification of new products needing setup
- Barcode retrieval progress tracking

#### Scanning Interface
- **Mobile-Optimized Design**: Touch-friendly for warehouse tablets
- **Barcode Input**: Auto-focus input field for scanner integration
- **Quantity Controls**: Quick +1/-1 buttons and manual entry
- **Progress Dashboard**: Real-time completion statistics
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded item status (complete, partial, missing, excess)
- **Filter Views**: All items, missing only, discrepancies, etc.

#### Summary & Reporting
- **Discrepancy Report**: Detailed list of missing/excess items
- **Value Analysis**: Financial impact of delivery variances
- **Supplier Credit Form**: Pre-filled credit claim for missing items
- **Completion Actions**: Stock update confirmation and archival

### Barcode Handling

#### Extraction Process
- Access Udea product detail pages via authenticated scraping
- Extract EAN/UPC codes from product specification sections
- Support multiple barcode formats (EAN-13, UPC-A, etc.)
- Validate extracted codes using check digit algorithms
- Store barcodes for future deliveries from same supplier

#### Scanning Logic
- **Primary Match**: Barcode to delivery item barcode
- **Fallback Match**: Manual product lookup if barcode missing
- **Unmatched Handling**: Log unknown barcodes for investigation
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Track scans to prevent double-counting

### Integration Points

#### POS System Integration
- Read existing product data from uniCenta database
- Update stock levels via appropriate APIs or direct database updates
- Sync cost prices when supplier prices change
- Maintain audit trail of all stock movements

#### Supplier Integration
- Automatic barcode retrieval from Udea website
- Price comparison with current cost prices
- Detection of price changes requiring approval
- Support for multiple supplier formats (extensible)
