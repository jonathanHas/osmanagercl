3. **Status Indicators**: Use âœ… (implemented), ðŸš§ (in development), ðŸ“‹ (planned)
4. **Cross-references**: Link to related systems and documentation
5. **Update this README**: Add new systems to the appropriate sections

## Navigation Structure

Management systems are organized under the main navigation and follow consistent patterns:

- **Route Naming**: Descriptive routes (e.g., `/receipts`, `/inventory`, `/staff`)
- **Controller Organization**: Dedicated controllers per system
- **UI Consistency**: Shared design patterns and color schemes
- **Permission Integration**: Role-based access control ready
